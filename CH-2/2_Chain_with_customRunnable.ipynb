      "DOCKER is like a tool that helps developers create, share and run applications quickly by using containers instead of traditional virtual machines or physical computers. Think of it as having multiple mini-computers packed inside one big computer called Docker Hub where you can find lots of pre-made packages to help build your own projects without worrying about software compatibility issues because all the necessary tools are already bundled together in a containerized format, making development faster and easier for developers.\n",
