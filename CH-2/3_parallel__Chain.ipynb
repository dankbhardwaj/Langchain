      "{'definition': 'Docker is an open-source platform that simplifies the process of building, testing, and deploying applications by using containers. It allows developers to package up an application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container that can run anywhere modern operating systems are supported, ensnerving consistent execution across different environments.', 'example': 'Docker is commonly used in the development and deployment process for web applications. A practical use case would be when developing an e-commerce website, such as \"ShopSmart\". The ShopSmart team can create individual containers that each represent different components or services required by their application (e.g., one container with a database service like MySQL to store product and customer information; another for the web server where users interact with products).\\n\\nWhen developing, these separate Docker containers allow developers on the \"ShopSmart\" team to work independently without interfering with each other\\'s development environment or affecting shared resources. They can also easily replicate production-like environments in their local machines by running multiple instances of a containerized service simultaneously (e.g., load testing).\\n\\nOnce ShopSmart is ready for deployment, Docker containers are used to package the application and its dependencies together into one deployable unit that runs consistently across different systems or servers without worrying about environment inconsistencies like missing libraries or configuration issues – this ensures smooth operation of their e-commerce website. \\n\\nFurthermore, when ShopSmart wants to update a specific component (e.g., updating the payment gateway), they can simply pull down an updated container image and replace it with minimal downtime by using Docker\\'s rolling updates feature or orchestration tools like Kubernetes - which automatically handles these replacements for them, ensuring smooth user experience throughout their website operations without affecting other components.\\n\\nThis example demonstrates how the use of containers can simplify development processes and ensure consistent deployments across different environments while also providing flexibility in updating individual services with minimal impact on overall system performance or availability.'}\n"

      " Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, standalone containers that include everything needed to run the software. This includes hardware, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, configurations, and libraries, ensinning a consistent environment for the application no matter where it is deployed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      " Docker is commonly used in the development and deployment process to create, run, and share applications. Here's an example: A software company wants to develop a web application that can be easily deployed on various cloud platforms without worrying about compatibility issues between different operating systems or environments. They decide to use Docker containers for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, they write their code in Python using Flask as the framework and create a `Dockerfile` which defines how the container should look like: \n",
      "\n",
      "```dockerfile\n",
      "FROM python:3.8-alpine\n",
      "WORKDIR /app\n",
      "COPY requirements.txt .\n",
      "RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
      "COPY . .\n",
      "CMD [\"python\", \"./app.py\"]\n",
      "```\n",
      "This `Dockerfile` starts with a lightweight Python image, sets the working directory to `/app`, copies their project'in dependencies and code into it using COPY command in Dockerfile then installs these requirements via pip installation step RUN command before executing the main application script by default. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, they build an image from this `Dockerfile` with:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "docker build -t my-python-app .\n",
      "```\n",
      "This creates a containerized version of their Python app that can run on any system where Docker is installed and running without worrying about the underlying operating systems or environments. \n",
      "\n",
      "After building, they push this image to an online registry like Docker Hub:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "docker tag my-python-app username/my-python-app:latest\n",
      "docker login\n",
      "docker push username/my-python-app:latest\n",
      "```\n",
      "This makes the containerized version of their Python app available for others to pull and run on any system where they have access. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, another company wants to deploy this web application in AWS EC2 instance which is running Ubuntu as an operating system. They can easily do so by pulling the Docker image from the registry:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "docker pull username/my-python-app:latest\n",
      "```\n",
      "And then run it on their EC2 instance with: \n",
      "```bash\n",
      "docker run -d --name my-web-app -p 80:80 username/my-python-app:latest\n",
      "```\n",
      "This will start the containerized version of Python web application and map port `80` inside Docker Container to Port `80` on EC2 instance. The company can now access their app via a browser using public IP address or DNS name with HTTP protocol, without worrying about compatibility issues between different operating systems as it is running in the containerized environment provided by Docker. \n",
